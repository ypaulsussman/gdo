## Who are you, and why should I care?
I’m Y Sussman! I live in MPLS, MN, where I write code for work and teach for fun. (_I used to teach for work and write code for fun._)

I moved here from New York, a couple years back; while there, I went to grad school (_linguistics_), had fun (_teaching at libraries and universities; building language-learning apps_), and got married (_hi, Zoe!_) 

Prior to that I lived in Warsaw (_teaching at university_), rural Ukraine (_Peace Corps_), and Wisconsin (_no one asked me; it was the 80's_.)

And you probably shouldn’t.

## What is this site, and how was it built?

Like any good programmer, I've spent far more time on rewriting this site's code than on populating its content.

[V1](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/learning-log) and [V2](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/yblog) had a couple things in common: 
* they were both adapted from preexisting boilerplate repos; 
* they were both built on top of [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/use-cases/developer/), and
* they were each intended as a traditional blog, a container of polished public displays of what I'd been learning and doing.

[This site](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/gdo) is none of those. It's mine from the `npm init -y` up, and builds using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/).

Perhaps most importantly, it's underpinned by a [slightly different philosophy](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up). 

I no longer aim to leverage the desire not to be embarrassed by slipshod work and presentation (_though nothing wrong with that practice! Historically, though, it motivates me... not to write a perfect blog post, but rather to spend 3 hours reading others'._)

Any content from before 2022, then? Earnest strivings to carve, file, and trim the mess in my skull down into blog posts, into cohesive mini-essays.

Any content from 2022 or after? That's me doing my best to work with the garage door open. 

I'm not sure, yet, whether they'll meet the ~criteria of [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) - but I aim to make the new content much rougher, more provisional, and more associative than my prior writings.

## Why did you spend time building this, and what are next steps?

I _like_ spending my evenings and weekends reading about [teaching, thinking, language, learning, technology]. And I like thinking about what I read. Sometimes I even like doing things based on those thoughts!

But how to know any of it's _good?_ 

My plan is to: 
- add content to this site as promiscuously as if it were private (_it's non-SEO'd to the point it might as well be!_), then
- mercilessly rework and update that content over the passage of time, all the while
- having a readily-available public URL to share, conveniently, when I'd like someone's input.

As for next steps: currently, I can't imagine any changes to the codebase beyond
1. adding content and 
2. bumping dependencies... 

...but I'm sure I'm overlooking something. And that's kind of the fun of it, no?
