I have both a mortgage, and a cautious nature.

As such, I'm currently content to create web applications for others, in exchange for a steady (_and generous_) paycheck.

In time, I hope to return to some combination of teaching, research, and creation -- once again at the intersection(s) of pedagogy, psychology, linguistics, and technology.

These notes describe topical ideas and imaginings that either:
1. emerge from usage of [`mokko`](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/mokko_api/), or 
2. arrive without an immediately-obvious source.

My plan is to reify, digest, explore, and likely discard the majority of these musings/thought experiments.

The hope is that I'll be left with a corpus of research avenues and cool problems; I could then reference these in the future, as I winnow down how to spend my time on leaving professional software development.

(_...come the early 2030's._)
