When hacking away at some proof-of-concept app, I try to keep a separate plaintext file.

In it, I detail the major:

- technical/architectural decisions,
- sticking-points,
- digressions, and
- next steps.

The posts herein aim to extract and clean those notes, then furnish them with context:

- my initial goals,
- where the project stands, and
- what I'd do differently next time.

(_One hope is, in the future, for this section to include ~postmortems not merely on toy software: but also on undertakings like volunteer work/committees, protracted research projects, and even long-form writing._

_...in the future._)
