I'm collating these now, as I'm working through Duolingo's UA path for a refresher.

My plan is to return to them, after completion, to order and schematize them by linguistic structure. There might be a pattern to what's fallen out of my memory over ~13 years of minimal usage!

## Numbers 1 and 2
- "_Thousand_" is feminine: одна тияча, дві тисячі, п'ять тисяч

- Soft sign on the teens, 20, and 30: but not 50-80, e.g.
  - дванадцять, тринадцять... дев'ятьнадцять
  - двадцять, тридцять
  - п'ятдесят, шістдесят, сімдесят, вісімдесят

- 90 keeps the apostrophe but loses the "_t_": дев'яносто

- It's an "_і_" in the first syllable of both "_million_" and "_billion_" (they're not soap!); мільйон and мільярд

## Hobby
- You грати **у** шахи and грати **у** футбол 
  - NB for some reason you didn't have the same issue of forgetting the preposition for e.g. грати на піаніно
  - The English equivalents elide the preposition for each, however: _to play chess_, _to play soccer_, _to play the piano (or other musical instrument)_
  - Perhaps because "_to play on the piano_" sounds atypical, but not wrong; "_to play in soccer_", however, sounds indisputably incorrect?
  - Next step: corpus reference needed

## Food 1 and 2
- "_for breakfast_" (or, in the case of beverages, "_at breakfast_") takes the preposition **на** сніданок (likewise обід, вечеря, десерт)

## Cafe
- "_to reserve a table_" is замовити столик
