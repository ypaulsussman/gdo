## GDO ("Garage Door's Open")

This is gonna be my third iteration on "_static site where I post stuff with the goal of getting better at thinking and writing_"; I don't want to call it a "_blog,_" per se, because:
- the content won't follow the prose format typical to that genre; and
- the content will be deliberately elicited as almost data-exhaust from other ongoing projects (_rather than e.g. generated from freeform musings._)
